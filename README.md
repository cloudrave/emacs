emacs
=====

My emacs configuration files. Probably not helpful to anyone but me, but feel free to use whatever configurations I have.

Includes:

* auto-complete
* Ocaml syntax highlighting (tuareg mode)
* *molokai* and *solarized* color themes
* fixme highlighting (highlights `TODO`, `FIXME`, etc.)
* unbound (adds `M-x describe-unbound-keys` command)
* shortcuts
    * `C-c l` go to line
    * `C-c c` comment line
    * `C-c C` uncomment line
    * `C-c v` comment visual block
    * `C-c V` uncomment visual block

Instructions
============

Ensure that the `.emacs` file is in your home directory, not in `.emacs.d`, where it is now.
